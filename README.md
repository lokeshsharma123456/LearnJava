```
1. Entity Package (com.yourproject.entity)
	• Person Class: Base class with common attributes like name, age, address.
	• Employee Class: Extends Person, adds attributes like employeeId, salary, departmentId.
	• Student Class: Extends Person, adds attributes like studentId, course, year.
2. Repository Package (com.yourproject.repository)
	• EmployeeRepository Class: Handles JDBC connection and CRUD operations (e.g., addEmployee(), getEmployeeById(), updateEmployee()).
	• StudentRepository Class: Similar to EmployeeRepository, but for students.
	• DepartmentRepository Class: Handles department-related operations.
3. Service Package (com.yourproject.service)
	• EmployeeService Class: Contains business logic like validating employee data, calculating salary.
	• StudentService Class: Handles student-specific logic like course registration.
	• DepartmentService Class: Manages department-related operations like assigning employees to departments.
4. Controller Package (com.yourproject.controller)
	• EmployeeController Class: Exposes APIs or methods for adding, updating, and retrieving employees (e.g., addEmployee(), getEmployee()).
	• StudentController Class: Similar to EmployeeController for students.
	• DepartmentController Class: Manages department-related actions via endpoints/methods.
5. Database Connection Package (com.yourproject.db)
	• DBConnection Class: Manages the connection to the SQL database, using JDBC.

Flow Diagram:
	1. Controller (Input Handling) → Service (Business Logic) → Repository (Database Operations via JDBC) → SQL Database.
	2. For Employee:
		○ The EmployeeController receives requests, passes them to EmployeeService.
		○ EmployeeService validates the data and calls EmployeeRepository to interact with the database (storing employee in Employee and linking to Department).

```
1. Spring Framework (for Dependency Injection & REST Endpoints)
	• Why to Use:
		○ Spring simplifies managing the components (Controller, Service, Repository) with its dependency injection (DI).
		○ It provides a structured way to build REST APIs, which you can test using Postman.
	• How it Helps:
		○ Automatically wires your beans (classes) together, reducing manual configuration.
		○ You’ll define endpoints in controllers and Spring will handle HTTP requests.
	• Flow:
		○ Controller Layer → Expose REST endpoints.
		○ Service Layer → Business logic.
		○ Repository Layer → Communicate with the database via JDBC.
		○ You can define endpoints like /addEmployee, /getEmployee/{id}, etc. in your controllers, and Postman will help you test them.
2. Kafka (for Asynchronous Communication & Event Streaming)
	• Why to Use:
		○ Kafka can be used to decouple the employee creation process. For example, when an employee is added, the details can be pushed to Kafka, and another service can process it later (like notifying a department service, or logging it).
		○ It ensures asynchronous, scalable, and fast communication between services.
	• How it Helps:
		○ Kafka acts as a messaging queue where different components (like EmployeeService and DepartmentService) can communicate without being tightly coupled.
		○ Example: When an employee is created, a message (event) can be sent to Kafka, which the DepartmentService can listen to and handle accordingly.
	• Flow:
		○ EmployeeController → sends a message to Kafka (e.g., "New Employee Created").
		○ Kafka Consumer → listens for this message and updates the department or handles other tasks.
3. Redis (for Caching & Quick Data Access)
	• Why to Use:
		○ Redis can be used to cache frequent queries like fetching employee or department details. Instead of hitting the database every time, Redis can store the data in memory, improving the response time.
	• How it Helps:
		○ It reduces load on the database and speeds up read operations for frequently accessed data.
		○ For example, when an employee’s details are fetched, you can first check Redis. If the data is found, return it; otherwise, fetch from the database and store it in Redis for future use.
	• Flow:
		○ EmployeeService → checks Redis cache for employee data.
		○ If found in Redis → return it.
		○ If not found → fetch from SQL database via EmployeeRepository and store the result in Redis for future use.

Complete Flow (Combining Spring, Kafka, Redis):
	1. Client (Postman) → Sends a request to create an employee.
	2. Spring Controller → Receives the request.
	3. Spring Service → Processes the employee creation and pushes the details to Kafka.
	4. Spring Repository (JDBC) → Stores the employee data in the database.
	5. Kafka → Broadcasts a message about the new employee creation.
	6. Kafka Consumer (DepartmentService) → Listens to the message and handles any additional tasks (e.g., assign to a department).
	7. Redis → Caches frequently accessed employee/department data to speed up future requests.

This setup will allow you to:
	• Spring: Handle REST API requests cleanly.
	• Kafka: Add asynchronous event-based communication between services.
	• Redis: Speed up data retrieval by caching results.
